# YAK Pro - Php Obfuscator

**YAK Pro** stands for **Y**et **A**nother **K**iller **Pro**duct.

Free, Open Source, Published under the MIT License.

This tool parses php with the best existing php parser [PHP-Parser 4.x](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser),
which is an awesome php parsing library written by [nikic](https://github.com/nikic).

You just have to download the zip archive and uncompress it under the PHP-Parser subdirectory,
or make a git clone ...

### Warning:  
    yakpro-po 2.x is currently in alpha version.
    yakpro-po 2.x works on PhpParser 4.x   
    it will run on php >= 7.0, obfuscating code for php 5.2 to php 7.2   
    
    If you are running php 5.3 or higher,  
    Please use [yakpro-po 1.x](https://github.com/pk-fr/yakpro-po/tree/1.x) which works on 1.x branch of PhpParser.   
    


The yakpro-po.cnf self-documented file contains many configuration options!
Take a look at it!

Demo : [yakpro-po demo](https://www.php-obfuscator.com/?demo).

Prerequisites:  php 7.0 or higher, [PHP-Parser 4.x](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser).

Note: This tool has been written in order to obfuscate pure php sources.
it is not intended to be used with html and embeded php inside (you may try to deactivate statements shuffling...).
You can still embed html within php using the echo <<<END ... END; syntax!

## What is Php Obfuscation?

When you have a php project you want to distribute, as php is a script interpretor,
you distribute also all the sources of your software!

You may want, for any reason, that other people do not understand, modify, or adapt your software.

As your software must be understandable by the **php runtime**, but needs to be very difficult
to understand by human people, obfuscation is a very good way to achieve this goal.

### YAK Pro - Php Obfuscator Obfuscation Main Features:

- Removes all comments, indentation, and generates a single line program file.
- Obfuscates **if, else, elseif, for, while, do while** by replacing them with **if goto** statements.
- Obfuscates string literals.
- Scrambles names for:
  - Variables, Functions, Constants.
  - Classes, Interfaces, Traits.
  - Properties, Methods.
  - Namespaces.
  - Labels.
- Shuffles Statements.

- Recursivly obfuscates a project's directory.
- Makefile like, timestamps based mechanism, to re-obfuscate only files that were changed since last obfuscation.
- Many configuration options that let you have **full control** of what is obfuscated within your project!


### Why Yet Another Php Obfuscator?
I began testing some already existing php obfuscation tools, but I did'nt find one that was
fitting all my needs.
I wanted a **simple** command line tool, based on a **highly customisable** config file, that would be able to:
- Be fast and re-obfuscate only files that were changed based on timestamps of files.
- Preserve some files and/or directories from obfuscation.
- Not include in the obfuscated target, some files/directories that are present on the source project.
- Accept lists of names and/or name prefixes to not obfuscate.

So I started to write this tool.
Version 1.0 has been written within a few days...


## Setup:
    Note: This setup is also valid for Windows 10 Anniversary with bash installed...  
    1. Prerequisites: 
      * git
      * composer
      * php (cli)
    2. Navigate to the directory where you want to install yakpro-po (/usr/local is a good idea): 
       * cd /usr/local 
    3. Then retrieve from GitHub: 
       * git clone https://github.com/pk-fr/yakpro-po.git 
    4. Go to the yakpro-po directory: 
       * cd yakpro-po 
    5. Install dependencies: 
       * composer install
    6. Check that yakpro-po.php has execute rights, otherwise:
                                            # chmod a+x yakpro-po.php 
    7. Create a symbolic link in the /usr/local/bin directory
       # cd /usr/local/bin 
       # ln -s /usr/local/yakpro-po/yakpro-po.php yakpro-po 
    8. You can now run yakpro-po 
       # yakpro-po --help 
       # yakpro-po test.php 

    Modify a copy of the yakpro-po.cnf to fit your needs...
    Read the "Configuration file loading algorithm" section of this document
    to choose the best location suiting your needs!

    That's it! You're done!

####

## Usage:

`yakpro-po`
Obfuscates according configuration file!
(See configuration file loading algorithm)

`yakpro-po source_filename`
Obfuscates code to stdout

`yakpro-po source_filename -o target_filename`
Obfuscates code to target_filename

`yakpro-po source_directory -o target_directory`
Recursivly obfuscates code to target_directory/yakpro-po (creates it if it does not already exist).

`yakpro-po --config-file config_file_path`
According to config_file_path.

`yakpro-po --clean`
Requires target_directory to be present in your config file!
Recursivly removes target_directory/yakpro-po


## Configuration file loading algorithm:
(the first found is used)

    --config-file argument value
    YAKPRO_PO_CONFIG_FILE environment variable value if existing and not empty.

    filename selection:
           YAKPRO_PO_CONFIG_FILENAME environment variable value if existing and not empty,
           yakpro-po.cnf otherwise.

     file is then searched in the following directories:
            YAKPRO_PO_CONFIG_DIRECTORY  environment variable value if existing and not empty.
            current_working_directory
            current_working_directory/config
            home_directory
            home_directory/config
            /usr/local/YAK/yakpro-po
            source_code_directory/default_conf_filename

      if no config file is found, default values are used.

      You can find the default config file as an example in the yakpro-po.cnf file of the
      repository.
      Do not modify it directly because it will be overwritten at each update!
      Use your own yakpro-po.cnf file (for example in the root directory of your project)

      When working on directories,
      context is saved in order to reuse the same obfuscation translation table.
      When you make some changes in one or several source files,
      yakpro-po uses timestamps to only reobfuscate files that were changed
      since the last obfuscation.
      This can save you a lot of time.

      caveats: does not delete files that are no more present...
               use --clean  command line parameter, and then re-obfuscate all!

## Other command line options:
(override config file settings)

    --silent                            do not display Information level messages.
    --debug                             (internal debugging use) displays the syntax tree.

    --obfuscate-label-name                     obfuscate label names

    --scramble-mode     identifier|hexa|numeric         force scramble mode
    --scramble-length   length ( min=2; max = 16 for scramble_mode=identifier,
                                        max = 32 for scramble_mode = hexa or numeric)

    --whatis scrambled_name             retrieves original symbol from obfuscation context.
                                        (usefull for debugging your code when you give away
                                        obfuscated code, and keep the same obfuscation context).
                                        Tip: do not include the $ symbol, or use \$ because
                                        $ has special meaning in shell.

    -h or
    --help                              displays help.

## YOU MUST BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:
    If your obfuscated software makes use of external libraries
    that you do not obfuscate along with your software:

    if the library consists of functions:
            set the $conf->obfuscate_function_name to false in your yakpro-po.cnf config file,
            or declare all the functions names you are using in $conf->t_ignore_functions
            example : $conf->t_ignore_functions = array('my_func1','my_func2');

    if the library consists of classes :
            set the $conf->obfuscate_class_name,
                    $conf->obfuscate_property_name,
                    $conf->obfuscate_method_name
            to false in your yakpro-po.cnf config file...
            ... or declare all the classes, properties, methods names you are using in
                    $conf->t_ignore_classes,
                    $conf->t_ignore_properties,
                    $conf->t_ignore_methods.

    This is also true for PDO::FETCH_OBJ that retrieves properties from external source
    (i.e. database columns).

## Hints for preparing your Software to be run obfuscated

    At first you can test obfuscating only variable names...


    If you obfuscate functions, do not use indirect function calls like
        $my_var = 'my_function';
        $my_var();
    or put all the function names you call indirectly in the $conf->t_ignore_functions array!


    Do not use indirect variable names!
        $$my_var = something;
    or put all the variable names you use indirectly in the $conf->t_ignore_variables array!


    Do not use PDO::FETCH_OBJ  but use PDO::FETCH_ASSOC instead!
    or disable properties obfuscation in the config file.


    If you use the define function for defining constants, the only allowed form is when the
    define function has exactly 2 arguments, and the first one is a litteral string!
    You MUST disable constants obfuscation in the config file, if you use any other forms
    of the define function!
    There is no problem with the const MY_CONST = something; form!


## Performance considerations

    Except for the statements shuffling obfuscation option,
    the obfuscated program speed is almost the same than the original one.

    $conf->shuffle_stmts    is set to true by default.

    If you encounter performance issues, you can either set the option to false,
    or fine tune the shuffle parameters with the associated options.

    You must know that the lesser the chunk size, the better the obfuscation,
    and the lower your software performance!

    (during my own tests, the maximum of obfuscation costs me about 13% of performance)

    You can tune it as you wish!
